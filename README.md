# Eler
Welp, it's about time i've open-sourced this thing. I don't even wanna call it a bot because in all ways it's nothing but an inexplicable JavaScript mess.
<br>
This repo exists only for archival purposes. I have no intention of maintaining this, at all. The code is really terrible, half of it - no, 90% of it is just copied of off https://discordjs.guide, and the fact that I can't find a suitable hosting solution - Eler was being held alive by my phone, Termux and an unstable mobile data connection make me want NOT to touch this piece of garbage.
## How to run
God forbid you actually use this codebase for your bot. Sure, you could probably refactor it and make an actually good bot, but if you plan on using it as is - please don't. Please find another free bot template and use that.
<br>
If you still wanna run this, it's as simple as cloning the repo, installing packages and inserting your token into config.json.
```
git clone https://github.com/notsuu/Eler
cd Eler
npm i
```
Then you run it and hope it won't collapse into a stream of errors.
```
node .
```
